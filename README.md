# Chat DJ 
Chat DJ is a Discord Music Bot I made to make Discord voice chats more fun and interactive during quarantine. When someone in the voice channel types `!play <song URL>` in the message channel, Chat DJ will join the call and play music for everyone to listen to! Chat DJ currently supports Youtube URLs. Chat DJ is able to run the following commands:

- `!play <song URL>` - plays song from given URL or adds to song queue if a song is already playing
- `!current` - displays the current song and its info
- `!skip` - skips the current song and plays next song on queue
- `!stop` - stops the current song and shuts down the Chat DJ
- `!queue` - displays all songs in queue
- `!help` - show all possible commands and their functionality

Let me know what you think and please suggest what you would like to see with Chat DJ! :)
